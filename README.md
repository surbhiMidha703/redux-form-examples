# Examples

Below are a list of examples that demonstrate the capabilities of `redux-form` for testing and
learning purposes.

Each example is its own standalone web app with hot reloading. To prepare for running the
examples locally, clone the `redux-form` repository and run `npm install` to install the
necessary dependencies for `redux-form`. Then you can run the examples locally using either
two methods:

1. Run `npm run example:EXAMPLE_FOLDER` (Remember to replace EXAMPLE_FOLDER with the name of the
   folder for the example you want to run like `npm run example:simple` or `npm run example:material-ui`)

2. Manually run the following commands:

```
# Remember to replace EXAMPLE_FOLDER with the name of the example's folder
cd ./examples/EXAMPLE_FOLDER
npm install
npm start
```

After following either of these methods, open [`localhost:3030`](http://localhost:3030) in your
browser to view the example running locally on your machine.
